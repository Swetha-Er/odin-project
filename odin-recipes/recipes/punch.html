    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pear Bourbon Punch has everything we love about fall: warm spices, seasonal pears, classic bourbon, and gathering with friends and family.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>bourbon</li>
        <li>cinnamon</li>
        <li>fresh pear juice</li>
        <li>club soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Prepare the punch mix:</strong><br>Pour the bourbon, pear juice, and pear liqueur in a jar or pitcher that holds at least 32 ounces. Stir it to combine or if you used a lidded jar, secure the lid and shake well.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Serve the cocktail:</strong><br>Pour 4 ounces of punch mix into a tumbler. Top with 2 ounces of club soda. You can add more or less, depending on your preference.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Garnish the punch:</strong><br>Garnish each tumbler with thinly sliced pear before serving.<br><br>I don't add ice to this drink because it's punch and it's delicious at room temperature, but if it's hot where you are or you prefer ice feel free to set an ice bucket out so your guests can add it to their drinks if it's what they prefer.</p></li>
    </ol>
