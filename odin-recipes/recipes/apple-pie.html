    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is absolutely the best homemade apple pie you'll ever make! It has a flaky, buttery crust and a tender, lightly-spiced apple pie filling. Use a combination of apples for best flavor, and bake until the top is golden and the filling is bubbly!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>apples</li>
        <li>vanilla</li>
        <li>spices</li>
        <li>brandy</li>
        <li>cinnamon</li>
        <li>honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>To make it easier to roll out the dough, remove the dough disks from the refrigerator 10 to 15 minutes before using.</p></li>
        <li><p>Always place a baking sheet under the pie to catch any juices that bubble over so they don't land on the bottom of your oven.</p></li>
        <li><p>The apple pie is not done until the juices are noticeably bubbling. If you have an instant read thermometer, insert it into the center of the pie. A reading of 200Â°F is done.</p></li>
        <li><p>If the top of the pie begins to brown too much before it's fully cooked, tent it with foil.</p></li>
        <li><p>Want to make a lattice crust? We can help you with that.</p></li>
    </ol>
