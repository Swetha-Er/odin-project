    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="images/lasagna.jpg"/>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>ricotta</li>
        <li>shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li>onions</li>
        <li>bell peppers</li>
        <li>noodles</li>
        <li>tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></p></li>
    </ol>
